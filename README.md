# Hello, world! I'm Tanmay, an aspiring software developer from Muzaffarpur (Bihar), India.

I'm driven by a passion for technology and a deep desire to create innovative solutions that make a positive impact. My journey into the world of coding began with the day when I started my college to pursue BCA. From that moment on, I've been hooked, constantly seeking new challenges and opportunities to hone my skills.
